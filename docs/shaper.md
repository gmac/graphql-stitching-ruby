## GraphQL::Stitching::Shaper

The `Shaper` takes the raw output generated by the `GraphQL::Stitching::Executor` and does the final shaping and
cleaning. It removes data that was added while building the result, it also handles cleaning up violations that can
only occur at the end, such as bubbling up null violoations.

See the [Executor](./docs/executor.md)

```ruby
raw_result = GraphQL::Stitching::Executor.new(
  supergraph: supergraph,
  plan: plan.to_h,
  variables: variables,
).perform(document)

final_result = GraphQL::Stitching::Shaper.new(
  supergraph: supergraph,
  document: document,
  raw: raw_result).perform!
```
